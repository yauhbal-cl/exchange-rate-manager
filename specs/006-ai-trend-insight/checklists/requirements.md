# Specification Quality Checklist: AI Trend Insight (Local LLM)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. "Local LLM" and "no third-party AI service" in FR-006 are kept as business-level
  data-privacy/cost-control constraints (from user input), not a specific tech stack choice — this
  is treated as acceptable since it reflects a stated scope boundary, not an implementation detail.
- Ready for `/speckit-plan` (or `/speckit-clarify` if deeper review desired).
